## Homework Submission ##
I am writing this more to play with **Mark Down** than anything, I have not used that in the past.

I had some odd issues with **EXCEL** when I attempted to use filters for the last analysis
The problem was that the filter would only got to line 556, instead of throughout the entire document.
After the submission of homework, I redid the homework from scratch and the problem disappeared.
I work on two machines, the lap-top for school, which is painful, and my office system which has enough screen real-estate to play a football game. The problem was on that file.  I suspect that when I was playing around with *tables* in EXCEL that I confgured something that I could no unconfigure.
